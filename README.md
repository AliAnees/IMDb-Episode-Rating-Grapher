# IMDb Episode Rating Grapher
This project was built to graph the ratings of TV Show episodes across the seasons that it airs. It was built to provide users with a quick overview of how the quality of a show has progressed throughout its air-time. This full-stack application was built with `JavaScript` in the back-end, used for requests, searching, and graphing. On the front-end `HTML/CSS` was used create and intuitive interface. `SQL` was used to create and manipulate the database, due to the large amount of data present.
